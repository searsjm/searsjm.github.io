							</p>
							<p><i>Abstract: The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to "flatten the curve" through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and variation in state policy adoption, we characterize the direct impact of stay-at-home mandates on mobility and social distancing and link these behavioral changes to health benefits. We find evidence of dramatic declines in mobility nationwide prior to the adoption of statewide mandates. Despite these early reductions, we find that statewide stay-at-home policies induced "mandate effects" of between 4.1 and 5.9 percentage point declines relative to pre-COVID-19 levels for the first four states to introduce such policies. These effects persist when considering all states' mandates and alternate estimation strategies that account for states' differences in travel behavior prior to policy adoption. Using previous changes in mobility, we find significant effects on current mortality, with a 1% reduction in visits to non-essential businesses weeks prior associated with 9.2 fewer deaths per 100 million per day, corresponding to over 74,000 lives saved nationwide for the months of March and April 2020.  This suggests death tolls would have been nearly 2.3 times their actual counts during these months without these behavior changes. These averted deaths correspond with estimated economic benefits between $249-$745 billion for observed behavioral changes in March and April. These estimates represent a lower bound of direct health benefits, as they do not account for spillovers or undercounting of COVID-19 mortality. Observed reductions in mobility indeed contributed to flattening the curve and reduced the strainon the medical system during those two months. Our findings provide evidence that statewide stay-at-home ordinances induce additional social distancing, and ultimately help attenuate the negative health consequences of COVID-19, revealing themselves as important policy tools in the fight against pandemic. Further, substantial reductions in mobility prior to state-level mandates convey important policy implications for re-opening.</i></p>

                            <p><i>Abstract: Emerging technologies and services stand poised to transform the transportation system, with large implications for energy use and mobility. The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women’s preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion. </i></p>

                            <p><i>Abstract: Household response to conservation policy is a key parameter of interest for public water utilities. Utility districts around the country face difficult decisions during drought conditions, and must find ways to incentivize consumer conservation behavior in order to meet state-imposed reductions. This paper investigates one of these nontraditional policies: social pressure. Social pressure is an avenue through which behavioral changes may be induced, particularly for price-insensitive consumers. Drawing on unique variation in social pressure exposure generated by a recent drought ordinance in response to California's statewide drought, I investigate whether exposure to social pressure induced additional conservation response beyond that elicited by a fee. Using generalized difference-in-difference and instrumented generalized random forests, I find evidence of large reductions in residential water use in future periods once called out by news media for excessive use in the current period.

                            <p><i>Abstract: 
Many recent works have documented the existence of the “SNAP Benefit Cycle” in which a non-negligible portion of enrolled households exhaust their benefits early in the benefit month. Lack of benefits late in the month carries large consequences, with negative impacts ranging from reduced energy intake and nutritional content, to increased likelihood of hypoglycemia and pregnancy-related emergency room admissions, along with lowered test performance and increased disciplinary action for students. These effects diminish or are otherwise nonexistent for SNAP households that exhibit consumption smoothing. The ability for low-income households to complement resources from federal poverty programs with a local public good has major implications for household welfare and the value of food bank networks.   This paper investigates the extent to which SNAP participants in California utilize food bank resources to augment consumption throughout the benefit month.

                            <p><i>Abstract: 
Despite complete user anonymity, asymmetrical information, and incom- plete enforcement mechanisms, the deep web market Silk Road facilitated ap- proximately $200 million in illegal drug sales in 34 months. This study tests how the site’s reputation system facilitated successful transactions and how user feedback functioned as the primary signal of seller quality in the absence of formal contract enforcement. Using novel data from the site on marijuana, amphetamine, and meth transactions, listings, and vendors, I find strong evi- dence that consumers engaged with the site’s reputation system and relied on both item and seller-level information. Hedonic regressions provide evidence of a “bad news” learning environment, estimating a 3 to 11% price discount for negative item reviews. Seller ratings are found to act as an effective proxy for permanent seller characteristics, and named trains act as a primary source of quality (and price) differentiation for marijuana. I find no evidence of price penalties or signal heterogeneity for new sellers. This study is the first to shed light on the value of reputation on the deep web’s largest marketplace, yield- ing new insight into the mechanisms modern markets use to overcome social distance and prevent market failure.
